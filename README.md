# Nastycat
Nastycat is a tool completely made using python which replaces netcat. It comes in 2 versions of which both have their own pros and cons.
It is made for those situations where you do not have an actual netcat to do various tasks. Though the version 1 fails in some cases but the version 2 does not.

## Support
I appologize for the discomfort as the version 1 does not work in windows and the version 2 has some features which are not supposed to be run in windows environment.

## Responsibility
This tool is not meant for malicious purposes and I am not responsible for any kind of use of this script. It is totally upto the user who uses it.

## Contribution
Any body can voluntarily contribute to this project if he/she has a better idea.
